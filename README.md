# gaia-web
Gaia from B2G OS, hosted in web and browser extensions (Coming Soon)

# About Gaia
Gaia is a component in B2G OS (and Firefox OS) that consists of Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the main theme for system apps development. Gaia itself is mainly composed of CSS (theme styling) and Javascript (animation).

# Why host Gaia apps?
During the work in B2G OS, there is a big transition from non-standard web apps used in Firefox OS to web apps that use standard Web APIs and components. Old Firefox OS APIs are mentioned in MDN archives.
Recently, Mozilla plans to commit substantial change in Gecko (the core of all Mozilla products including Firefox and Firefox OS, as well as B2G OS) in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.platform/0t29OSSudOk/ePa44tM4AwAJ.
B2G OS developers are currently thinking to either fork the Gecko (including my fork at https://github.com/reinhart1010/gecko-dev) to keep B2G OS running, while others start to think whether the OS is based from Android.

# Firefox OS or B2G OS?
Firefox OS is released first under the codename "Boot to Gecko" or simply, "B2G". It was sold in some devices and carrier bundlings (NOT mentioning any brands and companies), but failed to survive. At 2016, Mozilla starts to stop develop Firefox OS, and the community starts to join as "Firefox OS is not dead", which is simply changed to B2G OS.
